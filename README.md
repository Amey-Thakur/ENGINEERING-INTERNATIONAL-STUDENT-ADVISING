     ========================================================================================= -->

## Overview

The **Engineering International Student Advising (ENG-ISA)** repository serves as a centralized digital archive for materials curated to assist international engineering graduate students. This collection is specifically designed to support the academic and professional success of students within the Faculty of Engineering.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of advisement checklists, workshop recordings, and essential templates. The primary motivation is to consolidate faculty-specific guidance—ranging from study permit extensions to career development—into a single, accessible research hub.

**Key Objectives:**

- **Academic Planning**: To provide streamlined access to historical academic calendars and scheduling resources.
- **Regulatory Guidance**: To archive essential checklists for TRV, PGWP, and Study Permit extensions tailored for engineering students.
- **Career Readiness**: To preserve workshop materials on resume building and financial initiatives.
- **Orientation Archives**: To maintain recordings of essential faculty-specific orientation sessions.

> [!NOTE]
> All materials were compiled and organized to serve as a supportive resource hub for the international engineering community during the 2023 academic year.
